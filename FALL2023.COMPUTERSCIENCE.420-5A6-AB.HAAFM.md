##  INTRODUCTION

This course covers the process of software development, consisting of
the proposal, design, implementation, documentation, and deployment of a
software project. In particular, students will iteratively propose,
design, develop, and release a mobile application for Android.

After this course, students will know how to learn new programming
language (Kotlin), a new development framework (Jetpack Compose) and a
new computational architecture (Android). More generally, students will
build confidence for application development generally across all
languages, frameworks, and platforms.

## SUGGESTED TEXT

TBD

## COURSE COSTS

TBD

## TEACHING METHODS

This course consists of 90 hours of scheduled lectures and lab work. In
addition, each student will be required to do 45 hours of personal study
that includes research, personally booked computer time and work at
home. Léa, the course management system within Omnivox, will be used in
this course.

## DEPARTMENTAL LATE POLICY

All assignments and projects are expected to be submitted by the
required due date. A late penalty of up to 10% per day might apply to
assignments submitted late up to a maximum number of allowed late days.
The exact percentage and the maximum will be indicated on the
instructions specific to that assignment. Any work submitted after the
maximum number of allowed late days has been reached will not be graded.

## DEPARTMENTAL ATTENDANCE POLICY 

See Article 4 of the IPESA,
[Policy-7-IPESA.pdf](http://departments.johnabbott.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Policy-7-IPESA.pdf)

Active learning of competencies requires hands on learning with
interactive classroom work, which requires no more than 20% absences.  

Attendance is compulsory for the following program activities:  \
  

- Stage participation. Competency 016V, 016Y.  

- Stage evaluation meetings. Competency 016Z.  

- In-class group or project integration.  

  

Unexcused absences of more than 20% of any of these activities will
result in a grade of 0 for the assessment related to that activity.  

**COLLEGE POLICIES -** IPESA, Institutional Policy on the Evaluation of
Student Achievement:
[Policy-7-IPESA.pdf](http://departments.johnabbott.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Policy-7-IPESA.pdf)

**Changes to Evaluation Plan in Course Outline** (Article 5.3)

Changes require documented unanimous consent from regularly attending
students and approval by the department and the program dean

**Religious Holidays** (Articles 3.2.13 and 4.1.6)

Students who wish to miss classes in order to observe religious holidays
must inform their teacher of their intent in writing within **the first
two weeks of the semester**

**Student Rights and Responsibilities:** (Articles 3.2.18 and 3.3.6)

It is the responsibility of students to keep all assessed material
returned to them and/or all digital work submitted to the teacher in the
event of a grade review. (The deadline for a Grade Review is 4 weeks
after the start of the next regular semester.)

Students have the right to receive graded evaluations, for regular day
division courses, within two weeks after the due date or exam/test date,
except in extenuating circumstances. A maximum of three (3) weeks may
apply in certain circumstances (e.g. major essays) if approved by the
department and stated on the course outline. For evaluations at the end
of the semester/course, the results must be given to the student by the
grade submission deadline (see current Academic Calendar). For intensive
courses (i.e. intersession, abridged courses) and AEC courses, timely
feedback must be adjusted accordingly;

**Academic Procedure: Academic Integrity, Cheating and Plagiarism**
(Article 9.1 and 9.2)

Cheating and plagiarism are unacceptable at John Abbott College. They
represent infractions against academic integrity. Students are expected
to conduct themselves accordingly and must be responsible for all of
their actions.

**College Definition of Cheating**:

Cheating means any dishonest or deceptive practice relative to
examinations, tests, quizzes, lab assignments, research papers or other
forms of evaluation tasks. Cheating includes, but is not restricted to,
making use of or being in possession of unauthorized material or devices
and/or obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance in writing
examinations, papers or any other evaluation task and submitting the
same work in more than one course without the teacher's permission. It
is incumbent upon the department through the teacher to ensure students
are forewarned about unauthorized material, devices or practices that
are not permitted.

**College Definition of Plagiarism**:

Plagiarism is a form of cheating. It includes copying or paraphrasing
(expressing the ideas of someone else in one's own words), of another
person\'s work or the use of another person's work or ideas without
acknowledgement of its source. Plagiarism can be from any source
including books, magazines, electronic or photographic media or another
student\'s paper or work.
